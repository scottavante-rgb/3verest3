## 3verest launches the world's first sovereign imaging platform for healthcare, with Summit AI providing contextual intelligence across healthcare environments

**Berlin, Germany | 10 November 2025**

3verest, the global leader in sovereign private cloud for healthcare, today announced the launch of the 3verest Imaging Platform (3IP), a world-class foundation for medical imaging and intelligent data management. The announcement, made in Germany, comes as the country becomes one of 3verest's most promising and strategically important markets. With three sovereign cloud locations now operational across Germany, 3verest is anchoring its European expansion in a nation leading the drive for digital healthcare sovereignty and compliant innovation.

## Born from 3verest 2030 Future Labs

The 3verest Imaging Platform was conceived within **3verest 2030 Future Labs**, the company's long-term innovation program dedicated to building the next generation of healthcare infrastructure.

3IP is a sovereign, intelligent, and interoperable foundation engineered for OEMs, PACS vendors, and diagnostic software providers who power global medical imaging. It enables partners to innovate freely without hyperscaler dependency, unpredictable cost, or compliance risk.

**3IP is not a product. It is the platform behind your platform**, strengthening the infrastructure beneath the world's most trusted imaging systems and combining sovereignty, transparency, and diagnostic-grade performance.

## A sovereign foundation for imaging innovation

3verest Imaging Platform unites control, performance, and regulatory assurance.

- **Jurisdictional assurance**: Region-locked sovereign zones operated by 3verest, compliant with IRAP, ISO 27001, NHS DSPT, C5, and ISR.
- **Sub-second access**: First-image latency target under 150 milliseconds.
- **AI-ready compute**: GPU clusters for reconstruction, segmentation, and inference.
- **Predictive elasticity**: Adaptive scaling for burst workloads.
- **Transparent economics**: Fixed pricing, zero egress, and no hidden API fees.

> "While hyperscalers focus on scale, we focus on trust," said **Scott Crawford, Founder and CEO of 3verest**. "Germany's leadership in digital health and sovereign cloud strategy makes it the ideal launchpad. 3IP gives healthcare organisations the foundation for performance, compliance, and complete control."

## Summit AI: an independent sovereign intelligence layer

Alongside the 3verest Imaging Platform, 3verest has partnered with **Summit AI** to introduce an additional layer of contextual, sovereign intelligence that can be applied across customers' existing healthcare environments — whether on 3IP, on-premises, or within regional sovereign clouds.

Summit AI operates on its own proprietary **Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Large Language Model (LLM) architecture**. It is entirely sovereign, trained and hosted within secure 3verest regions.

This new layer transforms healthcare data into understanding. Summit AI brings contextual awareness, adaptive workflow automation, and insight generation that evolves with clinical and operational data across systems.

- **Sovereign by design**: All inference and learning occur within 3verest capsules; no data leaves jurisdiction.
- **Contextual intelligence**: Models interpret workflow, language, and clinical intent in context.
- **Automation and insight**: Converts imaging and operational data into structured intelligence for faster, safer decisions.
- **Summit Gain Index (SGI)**: Quantifies measurable improvements in productivity, accuracy, compliance, and capital efficiency.

> "Summit AI delivers contextual sovereign intelligence that can sit above any healthcare system," said **Sheraz Bhatti, CTO of 3verest**. "It brings the power of AI to where the data already lives — securely, privately, and intelligently."

## For those who build healthcare's future

3IP empowers technology providers to embed or co-brand sovereign imaging solutions.

- **Embedded OEM**: 3IP powers partner platforms invisibly.
- **Co-branded editions**: Sovereign-ready versions of partner products.
- **Dedicated tenants**: Exclusive 3IP instances for enterprise clients.
- **Usage-linked licensing**: Flexible models tied to SaaS growth.

Each tier includes unlimited API calls, fixed regional pricing, and full audit transparency, protecting OEM margins while ensuring commercial sovereignty.

## Performance, interoperability, and transparency

3verest aligns with the standards healthcare already trusts.

- **DICOMweb** (QIDO, WADO, STOW) for ingestion, search, and retrieval.
- **FHIR** and REST or GraphQL APIs for workflow and analytics integration.
- **Event Hooks** and SDKs for Python, TypeScript, and .NET.

**Fast enough for radiologists.**
**Sovereign enough for regulators.**
**Transparent enough for finance.**
