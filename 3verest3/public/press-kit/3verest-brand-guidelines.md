## Logo Usage

### Primary Logo

**Correct Usage**:
- 3VEREST (reversed E + VEREST)
- Always maintain proper spacing and proportions
- Minimum size: 120px width for digital, 25mm for print
- Clear space: Minimum 1x the height of the "3" on all sides

**Incorrect Usage**:
- ❌ 3Verest (mixed case)
- ❌ EVEREST (no reversed E)
- ❌ 3verest (lowercase, except in running text)
- ❌ Stretching or distorting the logo
- ❌ Adding effects, shadows, or gradients
- ❌ Placing on busy backgrounds that reduce legibility

### Logo Variations

**Primary**: White logo on dark background
**Secondary**: Dark logo on light background
**Monochrome**: Black or white only, for single-color applications

### Logo Clear Space

Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "3" character on all sides. No other visual elements should enter this space.
