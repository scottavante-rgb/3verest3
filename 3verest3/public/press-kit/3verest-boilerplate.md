## Long Description (200 words)

Founded in 2017, 3verest was born from a singular conviction: that healthcare, technology, and artificial intelligence must work together to serve humanity's most critical needs. We believe the world's most vital data—the information that holds our bodies, our identities, and our futures—deserves infrastructure built specifically to protect it.

3verest provides sovereign cloud infrastructure that combines enterprise-grade performance with uncompromising data sovereignty. Our platform spans 19 sovereign cloud locations across Europe, North America, Australia, Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, ensuring healthcare data remains within jurisdictional boundaries while enabling global collaboration. Each region operates independently, respecting local laws, cultures, and the invisible borders that define nations and people.

For us, sovereignty isn't about isolation—it's about trust. It's about ensuring that healthcare, the most human of all sciences, operates within the moral and technical boundaries that respect the people it serves. We measure success not by scale, but by sincerity, by how faithfully our systems serve the people who rely on them.

Our technology is shaped by ethics, our infrastructure built with conscience. We partner with leading healthcare providers, OEM vendors, and AI innovators to create a future where technology and humanity move together, not in competition, but in partnership.
