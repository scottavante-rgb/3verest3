## About 3verest
3verest is a global sovereign cloud company specialising in healthcare. Founded in 2016, 3verest designs, builds, and operates private cloud infrastructure for hospitals, healthcare providers, and healthcare software vendors worldwide. Its mission is to deliver *the most trusted and intelligent cloud for healthcare*, combining sovereign control, engineering excellence, and AI enablement.

With regional clouds across Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada, and the United States, 3verest provides fully managed, dedicated environments for regulated healthcare workloads. The company partners with the world’s leading healthcare software OEMs—such as Intelerad, Agfa, Siemens, and GE Healthcare—to host and deliver their software securely and efficiently to hospitals and radiology groups.

## Positioning
3verest is **the Sovereign AI Cloud for Healthcare** — purpose-built for regulated environments where privacy, resilience, and data sovereignty are non-negotiable. Unlike hyperscale public clouds, 3verest provides dedicated, sovereign infrastructure where every customer’s data, compute, and security posture are isolated, verified, and managed to healthcare standards.

Its model combines the agility of cloud with the assurance of ownership. Clients can capitalise their 3verest environments as balance-sheet assets under recognised accounting standards—an industry first—while benefiting from the elasticity and global reach of a modern cloud platform.

## What 3verest Delivers

1. **Private Cloud Infrastructure:** Dedicated compute, storage, and networking designed for healthcare workloads, deployed in sovereign data centres and operated under ISO 27001/27017/27701, HIPAA, GDPR, HSCN, and IRAP frameworks.

2. **GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS):** High-performance AI and imaging compute environments using AMD MI300X, NVIDIA H100, and other GPU architectures, supporting advanced imaging, AI inference, and healthcare data science workloads.

3. **Edge Cloud:** Compact regional or on-premise capsules that bring 3verest capability closer to hospitals and imaging centres. Edge Cloud ensures low latency, local processing, and continuous operation even when disconnected from core regions.

4. **Sovereign AI Enablement:** A platform for healthcare software vendors and providers to run, train, and deploy AI models securely within sovereign boundaries. This supports the growing regulatory focus on AI governance and explainability in healthcare.

5. **Consulting and Architecture Services:** Deep domain expertise from 3verest engineers and consultants who specialise in healthcare infrastructure, integration, and compliance. 3verest works closely with OEMs to design, optimise, and manage cloud architectures for scale and performance.

6. **24/7 Global Operations:** A follow-the-sun operations model with engineering centres in London, Sydney, and Chicago ensures continuous coverage and real-time support across all regions.

## How 3verest Works
3verest operates on a **partner-first model**. The majority of its business flows through OEMs and technology partners who embed 3verest as their dedicated hosting backbone. These partners contract with 3verest under multi-year Master Service Agreements, while managing their end customers directly.

This model enables OEMs to deliver their software “as-a-service” globally without building their own infrastructure. It also ensures every deployment is consistent, compliant, and performance-verified.

3verest’s core technology stack is standardised worldwide. Each region is built on the same reference architecture—compute nodes, storage, networking, and security—allowing seamless replication and scalability. The company’s partnership with Equinix provides rapid global expansion capability through modular *cloud capsule* deployments, enabling new regions to be established in weeks.

## Why 3verest is Different

1. **Sovereignty and Control:** All data and systems remain within defined national or regional boundaries. Customers have full authority over where their workloads reside, how they are accessed, and by whom.

2. **Healthcare Expertise:** Every layer of the platform is engineered for healthcare — from DICOM performance tuning and PACS/VNA integrations to compliance, audit trails, and security frameworks specific to clinical systems.

3. **Concierge Service Model:** 3verest doesn’t operate like a public cloud self-service portal. It offers a managed, high-touch experience where expert teams handle provisioning, scaling, security, and optimisation directly, in close collaboration with each client.

4. **Capitalised Cloud Economics:** Unique financial models allow healthcare organisations to classify their 3verest infrastructure as an asset rather than an expense, supporting capital budgets and long-term planning.

5. **Sustainability and Efficiency:** 3verest data centres target Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ratios of 1.3 or better. Systems are designed for energy efficiency, heat reuse, and hardware lifecycle optimisation.

6. **Trust and Compliance:** 3verest maintains a comprehensive framework of certifications and audits, including ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27701, SOC 2 Type II, HSCN (NHS UK), and IRAP (Australia). All environments are aligned with HIPAA, GDPR, and the EU AI Act readiness criteria.

## Market Context
The healthcare cloud market is undergoing a structural shift. Hospitals and medical imaging networks are migrating away from legacy on-premise infrastructure toward secure, flexible cloud environments. However, public hyperscale clouds such as AWS, Azure, and Google often fail to meet regional sovereignty, latency, or contractual control requirements demanded by healthcare and government sectors.

This gap has created a growing market for *sovereign and vertical clouds*—clouds designed for specific industries with embedded compliance and regional assurance. 3verest leads this category for healthcare, combining domain expertise, technical scale, and operational trust.

Healthcare software vendors increasingly prefer to partner with 3verest rather than operate their own infrastructure, as it provides a global, healthcare-ready backbone with predictable cost and compliance outcomes.

---

## Customers and Partners
3verest supports a diverse portfolio of customers and OEM partners across radiology, pathology, cardiology, and general healthcare. Its deployments range from single-hospital private instances to multi-region cloud platforms serving tens of thousands of clinicians.

Notable collaborations include large-scale imaging deployments for leading hospital networks in Australia, Canada, and the UK, and platform hosting for international OEMs delivering clinical software to both public and private healthcare systems.

---

## Vision
3verest believes the future of healthcare infrastructure is sovereign, intelligent, and collaborative. Its mission is to provide the digital foundation upon which the world’s most critical healthcare systems operate — securely, efficiently, and sustainably.

By combining AI readiness, sovereign control, and a partnership-led model, 3verest is building the infrastructure layer for the next generation of healthcare innovation.
